 * Is designed to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone replacements
 * for strncpy(3). Unlike strncpy(), strlcpy() take the full \a size of the
 * buffer (not just the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result
 * (as long as \a size is larger than 0)
 *
 * If libc has strlcpy() then that version will override this implementation.
 *
 * \arg dest Where to copy the string to
 * \arg src Where to copy the string from
 * \arg size Size of destination buffer
 *
 * \note A byte for the NUL should be included in \a size. Also note that
 *       strlcpy() only operate on true "C" strings. This means that for
 *       \a src must be NUL-terminated.
