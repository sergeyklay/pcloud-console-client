# Tools

This directory is designated for holding extra scripts and tools related to
developing and contributing to the project. For example, turn-key build scripts,
linting scripts, code-generation scripts, test scripts, or other tools that may
be useful to a project develop.

The contents of this directory should not be relevant to a project consumer.
